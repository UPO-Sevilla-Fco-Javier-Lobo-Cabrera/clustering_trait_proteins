Code and data repositories with already computed results for the stochastic simulations.

The clustering_trait_proteins/analysis_of_results.Rmd file generates the plots and other useful information in this work from the obtained results. If you would like analysis_of_results.Rmd to make calculations based on your executions you need first to locate your generated files in the corresponding already_computed_results. This is explained in extensive detail in the clustering_trait_proteins/analysis_of_results.Rmd file.
